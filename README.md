# CHIP-8 disassembler
> This tool aims to disassemble CHIP-8 programs into pseudo-assembly. It can be useful for debugging when writing a CHIP-8 emulator or for exploring CHIP-8 programs.

## Setup
To install, simply clone this project and run `make`. This will output the program called _disassembler_.

## Usage
You can use this tool using the following command: `./disassembler file`, where file is the path to your CHIP-8 program.

## Status
the project is: _finished_. I have no further plans to implement instructions for the Super Chip-48.

## Inspiration
This tool is highly inspired by the following sources
